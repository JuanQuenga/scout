After installing the Scout extension, users should pin it to their Chrome toolbar for quick access:

### Why Pin the Extension?

- Quick access to the extension icon
- Easy visual indicator that Scout is active
- One-click access to extension features
- Faster access to the popup menu

### How to Pin

1. Click the **Extensions icon** (puzzle piece) in the Chrome toolbar
2. Find **Scout** in the list of extensions
3. Click the **pin icon** next to Scout
4. The Scout icon will now appear in your toolbar

Alternatively:

- Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
- Find Scout and ensure it's enabled
- Click the Extensions icon (puzzle piece) in the toolbar
- Pin Scout from the dropdown

## Accessing the Install Page

### From the Landing Page

1. Open the extension options page
2. Click the "Install Extension" button in the header

### Direct URL

The install page can be accessed directly at:

```
chrome-extension://[EXTENSION_ID]/install.html
```

Replace `[EXTENSION_ID]` with the actual ID of your installed extension.

## Testing

To test the install page functionality:

1. Load the extension in developer mode
2. Open the browser console
3. Run the test script:
   ```javascript
   // Copy and paste the contents of test-install.js in the console
   ```

## Building

The install page is automatically included when building the extension:

```bash
npm run build
```

The install page will be available in the `.output/scout/` directory.

### WXT Configuration

The install page is automatically detected by WXT as an "unlisted-page" entrypoint. No additional configuration is required in `wxt.config.ts`. The page is accessible via `chrome.runtime.getURL("/install.html")` from within the extension.

## Customization

### Modifying Thank You Message

Edit the thank you message in `ThankYouPage.tsx` to customize the post-installation experience. The component uses a welcoming approach with clear pinning instructions.

- Title and description
- Icon from lucide-react
- Screenshot image path
- How-to-use steps or subsections
- Features list (for simpler features)

### Changing Download Link

If you need to update the download link, modify the reference in `ThankYouPage.tsx`. The current release structure uses the GitHub releases or a direct download link format.

## Browser Compatibility

The thank you page is designed for Google Chrome. A compatibility notice is shown for non-Chrome browsers.

## Styling

The thank you page uses Tailwind CSS for styling and follows the same design system as the rest of the extension.
