## Latest Release

### v1.0.8 (Current)

**Release Date:** October 04, 2025
**Download:** [paymore-chrome-v1.0.8.zip](./paymore-chrome-v1.0.8.zip)

**What's New:**

### Features

- **Search Provider Switching**: When a search provider is active in CMDK, all available search providers are now displayed in the list, making it easy to switch between them
- **Active Provider Indicator**: The currently active search provider shows a green "Active" badge
- **Quick Links Reverse Sort**: Categories now display in reverse alphabetical order (Warranty first, then Z→A) while links within categories remain alphabetically sorted

### Improvements

- **Backspace to Exit Search**: Press Backspace when the search query is empty to deactivate the current search provider
- **Keyboard Shortcut Update**: Changed toolbar toggle shortcut from `CMD+Shift+H` to `CMD+Shift+L` (Mac) / `CTRL+Shift+H` to `CTRL+Shift+L` (Windows/Linux)
- **Build Output Optimization**: Simplified build output directory structure to `.output/paymore-chrome/{files}` (removed nested `chrome-mv3` folder)
- **Settings Button Fix**: Corrected settings toolbar button to properly open options popup using the action API
- **Updated Tooltips**: Toolbar buttons now show keyboard shortcuts in tooltips (Dismiss: ⌘⇧L, Settings: ⌘⇧O)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed CMDK settings tool handler to use correct message format (`action` instead of `type`)
- Removed duplicate settings button from toolbar scroll area
- Corrected build configuration to prevent double-nested output directories
